Instructions

Use the "Draw" mode button to begin drawing. Select drawing type (first dropdown) and stroke thickness (second dropdown).
Next, choose fill and stroke colours.
After drawing shapes, use the "Select" mode button to select shapes and manipulate them. After selecting a shape, its fill and stroke colours,
transformation, and stroke thickness may be changed. Also enabling the "Multi" button lets you do this to multiple shapes at once.
The File, Edit, and Format menu items allow alternative methods of manipulating drawings, as well as keyboard shortcuts.
